Steps to do
1. Get the basic framework of the html with the general bootstrap Framework 
2. Create an array of buttons.
3. Create on clicks "function" based on button varibles.
4. Jquery on click functions should call a AJAX function ( and then probably wait)



So we need to define a general AJAX function to pass in query strings.... 
function Ajax ( operators url)
